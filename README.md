# Classification of Questions

## Introduction

This project, part of the "Taller de Deep Learning" course, aims to classify questions into two categories: sincere and insincere. Utilizing a dataset of over 250,000 training questions, each labeled as honest or dishonest, this endeavor challenges our understanding and application of Deep Learning techniques.

### Objective

The primary objective is to develop and train models on this specific dataset, focusing on their ability to accurately categorize questions. This task is pivotal in showcasing the practical application of deep learning models and underscores the importance of effective data preprocessing and model tuning.

### Dataset

The dataset contains more than 250,000 training questions, categorized as either sincere or insincere. It consists of two files: `train_set.csv` and `test_set.csv`, where each question is associated with its corresponding class (1 for dishonest, 0 for honest).

### Approach

The approach involves exploring the dataset, implementing various models, and training them to classify questions effectively. While pre-trained embeddings can be utilized, the models themselves must be built and trained from scratch. A significant emphasis is placed on the preprocessing of text data, ensuring data-driven and justified decisions.

### Evaluation Metrics

Model performance will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score, with a special focus on the F1 score due to the dataset's imbalance.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Main Libraries:** PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

### Notes

- This project is an academic exercise for educational purposes in the "Taller de Deep Learning" course.
- The task is designed to provide practical experience in building and evaluating deep learning models, especially in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- The dataset is deliberately chosen to offer a real-world challenge in model development and performance evaluation.
